# WordCount Program Experiments 

## Setup

We used the classic WordCount program to count occurrences of words in large text files. The input datasets were loaded from various sources, and we ran the WordCount algorithm using:

- Hadoop (with HDFS)
- Spark
- A simple Linux command pipeline (`cat`, `tr`, `sort`, `uniq`).

Each method was executed on different datasets to measure their performance on tasks of increasing size.

## Results

### Hadoop VS Linux

![alt text](image.png)

As we can observe, Linux is more efficient and `13 times` faster than Hadoop to realize those tasks. 

### Hadoop VS Spark

Here, Hadoop is `3 times` faster to complete this task than Spark on every dataset

# Social Network Problem Using MapReduce

The social network problem involves recommending friends to users based on mutual connections. We used MapReduce to solve this problem by calculating second-degree connections and ranking users by the number of mutual friends.

## Approach

1. **Map Phase:** For each user, create a list of all second-degree connections (friends of friends).
2. **Reduce Phase:** For each pair of users, count the number of mutual friends and sort them by this count to generate friend recommendations.

## Algorithm 

Our algorithm takes the following approach:

- **Input:** A tab-separated file where each line lists a user and their direct friends.

- **Map Phase:** Emit pairs of users who share common friends.

- **Reduce Phase:** Count how many mutual friends exist between each pair and generate the top 10 friend recommendations.

The code is available here : friend_recommendation.py

## Challenges 


One challenge was ensuring that no direct friends were recommended. We handled this by filtering out direct connections in the Reduce phase.

```
friends_filtered = friends_connection.filter(lambda line: -1 not in line[1]) 
```

## Results 

Below are the friend recommendations for the specified users based on our MapReduce algorithm:

| User ID | Recommendations                                           |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 924     |                |
| 8941    |                  |
| 8942    |                      |
| 9019    |                          |
| 9020    |                       |
| 9021    |                        |
| 9022    |                        |
